## 🛠 How It Was Made

Nexora Launcher was built with **performance, simplicity, and modularity** in mind.  

- **Framework:** .NET 8 with WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)  
- **Architecture:** MVVM (Models, ViewModels, Services) for clean separation of logic and UI  
- **Data Storage:** JSON-based game database (`games.json`) for easy backup and sync  
- **Installer:** Custom NSIS scripts for user-level or portable installation  
- **Updates:** GitHub Releases integration for automatic version checking and updates  
- **Design Goal:** Minimal bloat, fast startup, native Windows feel, expandable for future features  

**Lore / Purpose:**  
Nexora started as a personal project: indie devs and gamers needed a launcher that wasn’t slow, bloated, or intrusive. The goal was to create a fast, clean, fully controllable launcher that puts players first.
